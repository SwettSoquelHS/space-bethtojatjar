		    I have three classes running in this project. I have a normal Bubble, which is the little bubbles that are happening. I have a Jumbo bubble that is floating around the same way as the normal, but it is just bigger in size. The las class an oddball, which is the ice cube that just floats up to the top a lot faster then the bubbles and doesnt move as much as the bubbles. I had trouble trying to use super() in the Jumbo, it would declare it as I wasn't define the public Jumbo. It was weird. I worked on it for about 45 mins and Looked up trying to figure it out but I guess I just did something weird. Just had to kind of copy normal into Jumbo.
